## Flashy Cards project - Andrea Righi - Matr. n. 15483

#### I sent slightly late the Github address, I hope that this is not a problem for you.

I wasn't able to finish the whole project, mainly because I was not more able to change the state of the class; therefore I list my bugs here:

- the Deck class `does not show the update` which is done on its state, therefore the shuffle and restart functions do not work, even if the sorting algorithm works (*in console*) but does not update the graphics;
- the delete card button works, but again it `does not show any change in the graphics`: it is possible to see that the update is made by *exiting and entering again* in the deck display;
- the style is not well formed.



I was late in finishing the project because I first made an app version which included also the navigation props. I upload it here as well, but it was `severely bugged`: when a deck was modified (by deleting or adding some cards), I was not more able to modify anything in there. Before, it has no problem and it implements all the functions (except for rename deck and the shuffle and restart does not sort very well). This is the reason why I tried to change approach, but time was not enough.
